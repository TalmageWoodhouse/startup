        3072 is played by using the arrow keys to slide the numbers in
        thedirection of your choice. When an arrow it pressed the numbers slide
        as far to that direction as possible. Each time you slide a number a new
        number consisting of 3 or 6 will appear. If 2 of the same numbers slide
        into each other they will combine. The object of the game is to get the
        highest score possible and the game is over when the board is full and
        it is not possible to slide anymore.
