# 3072

[My Notes](notes.md)

3072 is game that is played on a 4x4 grid. This game is played by using the arrow keys to slide the numbers in the direction of your choice. When an arrow it pressed the numbers slide as far to that direction as possible. Each time you slide a number a new number consisting of 3 or 6 will appear. If 2 of the same numbers slide into each other they will combine. The object of the game is to get the highest score possible and the game is over when the board is full and it is not possible to slide anymore.
